Python MCP230XX I2C IO Expander Tools
-------------------------------------

A couple of basic tools I knocked up while playing with the MCP23017 on my Raspberry Pi. More info on my blog here: http://nathan.chantrell.net


mcp23017.py
-----------
A simple command line tool for setting outputs as high or low.

Usage: mcp23017.py -b <bank> -o <output> -s <high|low>

eg. to set GPA1 high: mcp23017.py -b a -o 1 -s high

Response: Output GPA1 changed to high

Requires python-smbus


mcp23017.wsgi
-------------

A web interface using Python and modwsgi. Can be controlled through the built in web form or via GET requests with optional JSON like responses. 

eg. to set output GPA1 high: 
http://rpi/mcp23017.wsgi?bank=a&output=1&state=high&mode=json

Response: {"GPA1":"HIGH"}

Requires python-smbus and apache with mod-wsgi. Note that you will need to make sure your web server has permissions for the i2c bus, eg. /dev/i2c-0

To do: Extend to cater for input as well as output and report on the current state of the outputs.
